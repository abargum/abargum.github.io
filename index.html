<h1> Introduction </h1> 

This page is the audio companion to the paper "Differentiable All-pass Filters for Phase Response Estimation and Automatic Signal Alignment". 
The following audio-clips presents different dry/wet mixes at 50% manipulated by a black-box colouration effect (preamp, saturator, overdrive). 
Two versions for each setting are displayed; a clean version with static dry/wet mixing, and a compensated version with phase compensation applied through differentiable all-pass filters.
